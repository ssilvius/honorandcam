# How We Met

It was a rainy Tuesday in downtown Seattle when our paths first crossed at that little coffee shop on Pine Street. Honor was buried in a book about sustainable architecture, and Cam was frantically typing away on a laptop, probably debugging some code that just wouldn't cooperate.

## The Coffee Shop Encounter

Cam had been coming to this particular coffee shop for months, always ordering the same thing: a large dark roast with just a splash of oat milk. Honor was relatively new to the neighborhood but had quickly fallen in love with the cozy atmosphere and their incredible blueberry scones.

On this particular day, the coffee shop was packed. Every table was taken except for one small two-seater by the window. Honor had claimed one side, and when Cam walked in with laptop in hand, scanning for a place to sit, Honor looked up from her book and smiled.

"You can share this table if you'd like," she offered, gesturing to the empty chair across from her.

## First Conversations

What started as a simple gesture of kindness turned into three hours of conversation. They talked about everything and nothing - Honor's passion for creating beautiful, sustainable spaces, Cam's latest project at work, their shared love of hiking, and their mutual inability to keep plants alive (despite their best efforts).

As the afternoon turned to evening, neither wanted the conversation to end. They exchanged numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history.

## The Rest is History

From that rainy Tuesday forward, Honor and Cam became inseparable. Coffee dates turned into dinner dates, which turned into weekend adventures, which turned into planning a life together.

Three years later, Cam proposed on the very hiking trail they had talked about during that first conversation at the coffee shop. Honor said yes (obviously), and now they're planning the wedding of their dreams.
