# Honor & Cam's Wedding

## A Love That Grew From Friendship

Cam and Honor's love grew from their friendship which blossomed 3 years ago. Through long distance, raising puppies, and taking new steps in education, their bond only grew stronger.

Now they're ready for their next adventure together.

## Our Celebration

We've decided to elope in an intimate, private ceremony - just the two of us taking those sacred vows. But our joy wouldn't be complete without celebrating with all the people who have supported us along the way.

**Join us for our reception on December 6th!** We can't wait to dance, laugh, and party with all our favorite people as we begin this new chapter.

Invites are coming your way soon!
