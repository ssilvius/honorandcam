# Our Story

## How We Met

It was a beautiful spring day in 2022 when our paths first crossed at the local coffee shop downtown. Honor was reading a book on urban planning while Cam was sketching architectural designs for a new project.

What started as a simple conversation about sustainable city design turned into hours of deep discussion about our shared passions for creating better communities.

## The First Date

Our first official date was a walking tour of the city's hidden gardens. We discovered that we both loved finding beauty in unexpected places and shared a dream of building something meaningful together.

## The Proposal

On a crisp autumn evening in 2024, Cam proposed at the very same coffee shop where we first met. Honor said yes before Cam could even finish the question!

## Building Our Future

Now we're excited to start the next chapter of our story together, surrounded by the family and friends who have supported us along the way.
